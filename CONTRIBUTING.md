# How to contribute

Proper documentation is essential for a good developer experience - we welcome external contributions in the form of issues and pull requests!

## Submit an issue

See something missing or incorrect in the documentation? [Submit an issue!](https://github.com/blackbaud/sky-api-docs/issues) 

## Submit a pull request

SKY API documentation is served via Markdown and HTML files that live in the `content` directory. The file structure in `content` mirrors the site navigation. Most of your edits will be to the files in `content`.

For simple changes, we recommend that you edit files directly in GitHub. You can submit a pull request after you finish your edits.

For more substantive changes:

1. Fork and then clone the repo.
2. Make your changes.
3. Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request. Your request should merge into the `develop` branch. 

We will review your pull request and, if necessary, provide suggestions for changes or improvements. 

## Running Demo

To run the demo:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `grunt`
3. Run `stache serve`
4. Open browser to `http://localhost:4000`
