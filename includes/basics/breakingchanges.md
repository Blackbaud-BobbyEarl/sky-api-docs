Breaking changes are any changes that could potentially cause failures in applications that consume SKY API. If an API change could cause API calls to fail or return different results than before, then we consider it a breaking change. This includes changes to entities such as new data types or property names, changes to response data types or status codes, and changes to result sets for collection endpoints. 

We strive to avoid breaking changes if at all possible, so breaking changes are few and far between. However, they are sometimes necessary. We only make breaking changes when we determine that they are critical, and we weigh the disruption that the breaking changes will cause. We strive to be transparent about these changes, and we announce them in [a changelog on the SKY API website](https://apidocs.sky.blackbaud.com/support/changelog/) and in [the Community blog](https://community.blackbaud.com/blogs/69) at least one week before we deploy to give consumers of the API time to assess the impact of the changes, to raise any questions, and to plan accordingly.

For more information about how we define and handle breaking changes, please see [the breaking changes post in the Community blog](https://community.blackbaud.com/blogs/69/3219).
