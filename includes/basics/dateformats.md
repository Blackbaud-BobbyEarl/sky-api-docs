Unless otherwise specified, dates are represented within the {{ stache.config.api_type_name }} in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339" target="_blank">ISO 8601</a> format.  Some endpoints may further support time components or <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#UTC" target="_blank">Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</a> format.  Refer to the specific endpoint documentation for details on what date formats are supported.

Note that fuzzy dates are handled differently from the ISO-8601 standard.  For more information on fuzzy dates, see <a href="#fuzzy-dates" class="smooth-scroll">fuzzy dates</a>.
