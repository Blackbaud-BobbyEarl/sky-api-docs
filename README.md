# SKY API documentation

Blackbaud's SKY API provides customers, partners, and developers access to open, industry-standard REST APIs that they can use to integrate with and extend the functionality of Blackbaud solutions. You can view the live documentation on the [SKY API developer portal](https://developer.sky.blackbaud.com/).

## Repository

This SKY API documentation repository is no longer accepting contributions. We have moved the documentation to a new website that is not hosted in GitHub.
