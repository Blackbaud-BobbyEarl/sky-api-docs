### New

SKY API Add-ins have been released for our Beta participants. Add-ins enable developers to build complementary features that integrate deeply within the user interface of Blackbaud's solutions. Add-ins are implemented as web applications that run external to the Blackbaud host application, so they can do almost anything that a webpage can do inside a browser.

This initial release includes documentation on [what add-ins are](/docs/addins/overview), [how to create add-ins](/docs/addins/), what [extension points](/docs/addins/concepts/extension-points/) are available, and more!
