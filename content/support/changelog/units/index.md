### New

The Statistical Unit API has been released for a private beta. This API handles information related to tracking statistical units for financial reporting and allocations.

The initial release contains endpoints to define non-financial statistical measures and manage counts for those measures. Note that this API is only available if you have Statistical units in Financial Edge NXT. At a future time, we will make this available for all Financial Edge NXT customers.

For more information, check out the **entity refs x-ref** and **endpoint refs x-ref** references.
