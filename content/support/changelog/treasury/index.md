The Treasury API has been released for a public beta. This API handles information related to bank accounts, including related entities such as adjustments, checks, and deposits.

The initial release contains endpoints to retrieve a list of all bank accounts and all bank account transactions, and to manage deposits, cash receipts, and adjustments. For more information, check out the [entity]({{ stache.config.treasury_entity_reference }}) and [endpoint]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_treasury }}) references.
