name: Implicit Flow
description: The Implicit Flow is carried out client-side within a browser-based app. Since the code is available to the browser, the <%= stache.config.guide_apps_client_secret_name %> cannot be kept a secret and is not used to request an access token.  As a result, the access tokens that are issued are short-lived and there are no refresh tokens to extend them when they expire.
