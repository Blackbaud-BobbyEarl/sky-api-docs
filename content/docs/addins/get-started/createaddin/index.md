To create a SKY Add-in, you'll need to build and deploy your add-in's web application and then register the URL of your add-in as part of your SKY API application.  When Blackbaud customers enable your application, users will see the add-in(s) you've defined.

<bb-alert bb-alert-type="success">
Before you begin, make sure you've created a Blackbaud developer account as covered in the <a href="{{ stache.config.guide_getting_started }}">Getting Started</a> guide.  You'll also need a registered SKY API application, as covered in the <a href="/docs/createapp/">Create an Application</a> guide.
</bb-alert>

## Build your add-in

Since add-ins are web applications, you can use any framework/tech stack desired, both client-side and server-side.  For example, you can use ASP.NET, PHP, Node.js, MVC, Angular, React, etc.  To see an example of an add-in that uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, see our <a href="{{ stache.config.guide_addins/get-started/hello-world }}">Hello World</a> sample add-in walk-through.

A requirement for SKY Add-ins is that the web application must include the Add-in Client JavaScript library on the page and instantiate the `AddinClient` class in order to facilitate the interop with the host application.  This library is available as an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blackbaud/sky-addin-client" target="_new">NPM package</a>, and more details can be found in the Readme.

At runtime, the add-in's web page will be rendered in a sandboxed iframe within the host application.  Note that add-ins are hidden by default until they are ready to be shown.  This gives the add-in an opportunity to perform any necessary initialization and logic to determine whether it should be visible or remain hidden.  When the add-in is ready to be shown, it will call the `ready` method provided in the `init` callback:  

```js
  // BBSkyAddinClient is global here.
  var client = new BBSkyAddinClient.AddinClient({
    callbacks: {
      init: (args) => {

        // perform any initialization work here...

        // inform the host page that the add-in is ready to be shown
        args.ready({ showUI: true, title: 'My Custom Tile' });
      }
    }
  });
```

## Deploy your add-in

In order to test your add-in, you can either deploy your web application to the cloud or serve it locally.  Note that for local development, youâ€™ll need to use HTTPS and have SSL configured to avoid mixed content problems in the browser.  

For production, your add-in's web application can be deployed to any cloud, and you control when and how your application is updated.

## Register your add-in metadata

<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">
<strong>Important!</strong> Performing this step will immediately make your add-in visible to any existing customers who've enabled your SKY API application.  For development and testing purposes, we recommend using a non-production SKY API application to ensure your add-in functions properly before registering the add-in with your production application.</bb-alert>

<ol>
<li>From <a href="{{ stache.config.developer_app_management_url }}" target= "_blank">My Applications</a>, navigate to the detail page for your application by clicking on the application name link.</li>
<li>Under Add-ins, select <b>Add</b> to launch the <b>Add add-in</b> dialog.
<p><img src="/assets/img/add_addin.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
</li>
<li>Enter a unique name for the add-in. Currently, this value simply provides a reference for your use only - Blackbaud solution users will not see it.</li>
<li>Specify the extension point for where you want to insert your add-in into the Blackbaud solution. For more information about extension points, see the <a href="{{ stache.config.guide_addins/concepts/extension-points }}">Extension points</a> documentation.</li>
<li>Specify the URL of your add-in.  This value must be an absolute and fully qualified URL, and can include static parameter values.</li>
<li>Click <b>Save</b> to save your add-in definition.
</ol>

At this point, your add-in will be provisioned for any existing customers who've enabled your application, as well as any customers who enable your application in the future.
